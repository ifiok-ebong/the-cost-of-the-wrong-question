## Initial Business Question (Flawed Framing)
"Why is net revenue growth slowing?" framed as a sales problem.

This triggered broad exploratory analysis across:
- Marketing spend
- Lead generation
- Sales conversion rates
- Market conditions

However, the framing assumes:
- The slowdown is primarily a top-line acquisition volume problem
- The issue lies within acquisition mechanics

This assumption is untested.

---

## Reframed Strategic Question
"Which structural driver is primarily responsible for the slowdown in net revenue growth: reduced acquisition efficiency, declining customer lifetime value, or pricing compression?"

This reframing forces comparison between competing explanations rather than exploring one assumed cause.

---

## Decision to Be Made
Prioritize one of the following strategic interventions:

1. Increase marketing investment to improve acquisition volume
2. Optimize pricing and packaging to improve revenue per account
3. Invest in retention initiatives to improve lifetime value

---

## Constraints
- Budget allows only one primary initiative this quarter
- Board expects measurable impact within two reporting cycles
- Operational capacity is fixed

---

## What Would Change the Decision
The decision would change if evidence shows:

- Customer acquisition efficiency has materially declined
- Lifetime value deterioration exceeds acquisition decline
- Revenue compression is driven by pricing or discounting rather than churn
- Pricing compression is concentrated in a specific segment or channel

---

## Decision Success Criteria
The selected intervention must:

- Address the dominant structural driver of net revenue slowdown
- Produce measurable financial impact within two cycles
- Avoid misallocation of capital based on incorrect assumptions
