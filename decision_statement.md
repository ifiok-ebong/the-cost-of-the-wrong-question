# Decision Statement

Chief Revenue Officer (CRO) and Executive Leadership Team

## Initial Business Question (Flawed Framing)
"Why is net revenue growth slowing?" framed as a sales problem.

This triggered broad exploratory analysis across:
- Marketing spend
- Lead generation
- Conversion rates
- Market conditions

However, the framing assumes acquisition mechanics are the primary cause.
This assumption is untested.

---

## Reframed Strategic Question
"Which structural driver is primarily responsible for the slowdown in net revenue growth: reduced acquisition output, declining customer lifetime value, or pricing compression?"

This reframing forces comparison between competing explanations rather than exploring one assumed cause.

---

## Decision to Be Made
Prioritize one of the following strategic interventions:
1. Increase acquisition investment to improve new account volume and value
2. Invest in retention initiatives to improve lifetime value
3. Optimize packaging and pricing to improve revenue per account

---

## Constraints
- Budget allows only one primary initiative this quarter
- Board expects measurable impact within two reporting cycles
- Operational capacity is fixed

---

## Dataset Constraints (Explicit)
- CAC and conversion rate are not available in the dataset
- Discount percentage is not available

Acquisition impact is evaluated via new account volume, contract value, initial MRR, and channel mix.
Pricing compression is evaluated via ARPA drift, plan tier migration, and seat changes.

---

## Decision Success Criteria
The selected intervention must:
- Address the dominant structural driver of net revenue slowdown
- Produce measurable impact within two cycles
- Avoid misallocation of capital based on incorrect assumptions
