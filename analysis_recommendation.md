# Phase 4 - Strategic Recommendation

## Recommendation
Primary conclusion (based on rolling 3-month impact): **pricing** is the leading structural pressure in the latest window.

## What this means
Prioritize a packaging and pricing intervention this quarter.
Focus on plan tier mix, seat contraction, and ARPA drift as the measurable levers.

## Risks and limitations
- CAC and conversion are not available, so acquisition is evaluated via output and value proxies.
- Discount percentage is not available, so pricing is evaluated via ARPA drift, plan tier migration, and seat changes.
- No cost data is available, so margin is not modeled.
- Expansion and contraction are inferred from account-month MRR deltas; validate with billing event logic in a real system.
