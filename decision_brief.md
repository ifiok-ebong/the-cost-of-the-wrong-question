# Decision brief

## Decision
Choose one primary intervention for the next quarter to address net revenue growth slowing.

## Options
1) Acquisition output focus
2) Retention and expansion focus
3) Packaging and pricing focus

## Constraint
One primary initiative this quarter.

## Method
Three competing structural drivers were tested independently, then compared using a simple additive decomposition.

Net Revenue (Monthly) is defined as the sum of account-month MRR.

## Recommendation
See `analysis_recommendation.md`.

## Stop rule
If the selected intervention does not move the driver-linked leading indicators within two reporting cycles, revisit the dominance assessment.

## Notes and limitations
- CAC and conversion are not available.
- Discount percentage is not available.
- No cost data is available, so margin is not modeled.
